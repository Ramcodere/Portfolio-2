Quotes App
Welcome to the Quotes App repository! This web application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on quotes. The app is built using MongoDB for data storage, Node.js for server-side scripting with Express.js, and React.js for the frontend. Various tools and libraries such as Axios, react-router-dom, react hooks, Vite.js, webpack, cors, dotenv, and nodemon are also utilized in the development process.

Features
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete quotes.
MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB as the database management system, with Mongoose for object modeling and schema validation.
RESTful API: Implements a RESTful API architecture for interacting with the quotes data.
Express.js Server: Utilizes Express.js to handle routing, middleware, and server-side logic.
React.js Frontend: Utilizes React.js for building the user interface, including features such as adding quotes, viewing more details, and deleting quotes.
Routing: Utilizes react-router-dom for client-side routing.
State Management: Utilizes React hooks for state management within components.
Webpack and Vite.js: Build tools for bundling and compiling frontend assets.
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
Cors and dotenv: Handles cross-origin resource sharing and loads environment variables respectively.
Nodemon: Monitors changes in the backend code and automatically restarts the server.
Technologies & Tools Used
Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
React Router DOM: A library for declarative routing in React applications.
React Hooks: Allows functional components to manage state and side effects.
Vite.js and Webpack: Build tools for bundling and compiling frontend assets.
Backend
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing quote data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
Cors: A Node.js package for enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
Dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
